This sample was taken during the installation of a new Siemens VFD (I don't know
the model number) at the top of a giant gantry crane int eh woodyard of a paper mill.
I happen to capture a munite and a half test they ran before placing the shielding
on the drive. So this recording was taken of an UN-shielded Siemens VDF.
